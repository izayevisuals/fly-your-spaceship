# Pilot Your Own Spaceship

Use the arrows to control your spaceship!

## My learnings: 

- Practiced the basics of JavaScript
- Learned different kinds of "event listeners"
- Learned the usage of "switch cases"
- Learned what "parseInt()" does and how it returns an integer

## Goals:

- I will continue to use this project to eventually build a game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS
- This project is for learning purposes only
- I will also update this README.md file as I get comfortable with GitHub
